Kubernetes
Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
In other words, you can cluster together groups of hosts running Linux containers, and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.
Kubernetes Components
When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.
The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.
This document outlines the various components you need to have a complete and working Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes Integration with Python-CGI
In this practical we are trying to interested k8s , JavaScript using Python CGI in this interrogation there are some features we can perform
Feature
👉 It can launch pods with specific name given by user.
👉 Run deployment using image and name given by user.
👉 Expose services on given user input port number.
👉 Scale the replica according to user need.
👉 Delete complete environment created.
👉 Delete specific resources given by user.
